## Starting üöÄ

_These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes._

### Pre requirements üìã

_For the project to work correctly, it is recommended to have a series of programs installed and configured properly:_
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/es/)
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

### Installation üîß

_When you have cloned this project into your local repository remember to execute the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies and that everything works correctly:_
```
npm install
```

### Environment variables .env ü™õ

_For the project to work correctly you have to enable the environment variables, for this you have to create a file with the name .env and enter the data you have in the .config.env template_


## Commands to run ‚å®Ô∏è

‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE STARTING, REMEMBER TO HAVE THE MONGODB SERVER STARTED ‚ö†Ô∏è

_Once all the necessary programs and dependencies are installed, just run the command:_
```
npm start
```
_Or you can also enter the command for the development version._
```
npm run dev
```

## when it start ü§î
_When the application starts, it will do the calculation to decrypt the PDF key, it will start the server and the users in the database and it will create the user with the admin role, which will have the next credentials:_
```
{
    "username": "jobx_admin",
    "email": "admin@jobx.com",
    "password": "aJOBX90_min25k.",
    "roles": ["admin"]
}
```
_The users that are entered by default in the database cannot be used to login, only in read mode, to test a user without an administrator role, create one from scratch._

## Endpoints üíª

_In the postman folder you have a json with all the configured endpoints._
